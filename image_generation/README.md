## CGAN_fashionmnist
In this notebook I've trained CGAN (conditional GAN) on torch dataset with elemets of clothes. The goal is to generate clothes based by user's prompts


## dc_gan_anime_faces
This notebook contains DCGAN (deep convolutional GAN) that generates anime faces.  Eventhough the faces are recognisable it still can be improved by continuous search of hyperparameters of the model and adding new layers.
